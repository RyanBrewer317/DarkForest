# The Dark Forest

A tiny game written for a game jam (Clover Jam 2) in Go, using Ebitengine. Playable without sound at https://rainingstudios.itch.io/the-dark-forest. While some changes have been made since the jam ended, The Dark Forest is not currently under development. I will likely come back to it at some point though, to add more polish.
